# K-means-clustering-using-Average-Silhoutte-method

Write a program in python to determine the “K” value for K-means clustering using Average Silhoutte method. Consider the “Iris” dataset available with Scikit Learn (with first 3 features as independent variables)and Euclidean Distance. Also provide the plot for the Number of Clusters(K) against Silhoutte Score, and Horizontal Bar Chart for different Clusters Distance against the Silhoutte Coefficient using Matplotlib. write a simplified code.
